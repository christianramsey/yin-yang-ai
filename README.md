# Yin-Yang Conversational Architecture
## Introduction
The Yin-Yang Conversational Architecture introduces a novel approach to building Conversational AI using Large Language Models (LLMs), blending rapid response capabilities with deep, contextual understanding. This architecture is designed to support complex reasoning and extensive processing without compromising the low-latency conversations that users expect.

## Key Features
Dual-Mode Operation: Integrates the quick-response "Yang" mode for immediate interaction and the deep-thinking "Yin" mode for background analysis and insight gathering.
## Dynamic Conversational Memory: Centralizes conversation data, allowing for seamless interaction between Yin and Yang modes, enriching conversations with insights derived from ongoing analysis.
## Adaptive Intelligence: Tailors responses in real-time, leveraging deep insights for more personalized and contextually relevant interactions.
Continuous Learning: Employs reflective analysis for ongoing improvement, refining conversation strategies based on dialogue evolution.

## Installation
Copy code
pip install yin-yang-ai
Usage
Initialize the Architecture:

Import the library and initialize both Yin and Yang components.
Configure the LLM of your choice (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 2.1) as a parameter for Yin's memory to dynamically update conversations.
Define Your Pydantic Models:

Specify structured insights (e.g., Person, Product objects) for Yin to track.
Utilize unstructured insights for flexible, text-based observations and notes.
Run the Conversation:

Engage Yang for immediate user interactions.
Allow Yin to observe and update the conversation memory with insights, deciding when to enrich the dialogue based on the significance of new messages.
Example
python
Copy code
from yin_yang_conversational_ai import YinYangArchitecture, Person, Product

# Define your conversation
conversation_id = "12345"
student_id = "67890"

# Initialize the architecture with your chosen LLM
yy_architecture = YinYangArchitecture(llm="gpt-4")

# Example Pydantic models for structured insights
class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

class Product(BaseModel):
    name: str
    url: str

# Start the conversation
yy_architecture.start_conversation(conversation_id, student_id)

# Example of a conversation turn
yy_architecture.process_message(conversation_id, "What is the essence of Zen?")
